# slickgrid2

This repo contains multiple packages in directories:

* examples: run `npm install && npm start` to give it a whirl!
* slickgrid2: the main component

## Objectives

* slickgrid2 is currently undergoing a ton of changes - if you use this package, expect the features/interface to break regularly.
* A good amount of code is being thrown out right now (e.g. enableColumnReorder, flashCell, etc.) with the goal of modularization/pluggability & replacing with a better implementation in the future.
* The UX point of reference is Excel (i.e. keystrokes, mouse behavior, etc.).
